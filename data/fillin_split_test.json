A. Fuller Maitland, in The Times, expressed reservations, writing that the opera's \"best portions rise so far above anything else that Sir Arthur Sullivan has given to the world, and have such force and dignity, that it is not difficult to forget the drawbacks which may be found in the want of interest in much of the choral writing, and the brevity of the concerted solo parts.\" Sullivan's 1897 ballet Victoria and Merrie England was one of several late pieces that won praise from most critics: Sir Arthur Sullivan's music is music for the people."
