        "rewrite sen": "The Leaning Tower of Pisa, officially known as both the Torre pendente di Pisa and Torre di Pisa, is an enduring symbol of Italy, located in the Piazza del Duomo alongside the cathedral, baptistery, and cemetery, all of which collectively were recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987. Following concerns for public safety that were heightened by the collapse of the Civic Tower of Pavia in 1989, the tower was closed to the public on 7 January 1990 to undergo stabilization efforts. These efforts were critical in preserving the tower, which was constructed with a blend of Romanesque and Gothic elements by Tommaso di Andrea Pisano. Notably, construction phases were overseen by individuals like Benenato, son of Gerardo Bottici, who took charge on 27 December 1233, and later by Guido Speziale, son of Giovanni Pisano, who was elected on 23 February 1260. The tower's unique tilt, originally unintended and resulting from foundation issues, has been scrutinized for its vulnerability to seismic activity. A 2018 investigation revealed that the tower\u2019s survival over centuries, even in the face of earthquakes, is due to the interplay between its height and construction materials with the softness of the foundation soil, preventing it from resonating with earthquake ground motions. This phenomenon was recognized internationally when the Italian government sought global assistance on 27 February 1964 to prevent its collapse. Although the Tower of Pisa was once deemed the world's most lopsided building, it was later surpassed by the Capital Gate building in Abu Dhabi, UAE, which was certified by Guinness World Records in June 2010 for having a deliberate 18-degree slope, significantly more pronounced than that of the Tower of Pisa."

All but 53 of the more than 900 moai known to date were carved from tuff (a compressed volcanic ash) from Rano Raraku, where 394 moai in varying states of completion are still visible today.;\n2. However, the easily worked tuff from which most moai were carved is easily eroded, such that the best place to see the surface detail is on the few moai carved from basalt or in photographs and other archaeological records of moai surfaces protected by burials.;\n3.

Creating the moai was one way the islanders would honor their ancestors; during the height of the birdman cult there is evidence which suggests that the construction of moai stopped.;\n5. This is partly because of the disproportionate size of most moai heads, and partly because many of the images for the island showing upright moai are of the statues on the slopes of Rano Raraku, many of which are buried to their shoulders.;\n6. Teams of workers would have worked to rock the moai back and forth, creating the walking motion and holding the moai upright.;\n7. In 2010, moai was included as a \"moyai\" emoji (\ud83d\uddff) in Unicode version 6.0 under the code point U+1F5FF as \"Japanese stone statue like Moai on Easter Island\".;\n8. Scholars currently support the theory that the main method was that the moai were \"walked\" upright (some assume by a rocking process), as laying it prone on a sledge (the method used by the Easter Islanders to move stone in the 1860s) would have required an estimated 1500 people to move the largest moai that had been successfully erected.;\n9. It is thought that the moai with carved eye sockets were probably allocated to the ahu and ceremonial sites, suggesting that a selective Rapa Nui hierarchy was attributed to the moai design until its demise with the advent of the religion revolving around the tangata manu.;\n",

All but 53 of the more than 900 moai known to date were carved from tuff (a compressed volcanic ash) from Rano Raraku, where 394 moai in varying states of completion are still visible today.;\n2. However, the easily worked tuff from which most moai were carved is easily eroded, such that the best place to see the surface detail is on the few moai carved from basalt or in photographs and other archaeological records of moai surfaces protected by burials.;\n4. Creating the moai was one way the islanders would honor their ancestors; during the height of the birdman cult there is evidence which suggests that the construction of moai stopped.;\n6. Teams of workers would have worked to rock the moai back and forth, creating the walking motion and holding the moai upright.;\n7. In 2010, moai was included as a \"moyai\" emoji (\ud83d\uddff) in Unicode version 6.0 under the code point U+1F5FF as \"Japanese stone statue like Moai on Easter Island\".;\n8. Scholars currently support the theory that the main method was that the moai were \"walked\" upright (some assume by a rocking process), as laying it prone on a sledge (the method used by the Easter Islanders to move stone in the 1860s) would have required an estimated 1500 people to move the largest moai that had been successfully erected.;\n9. It is thought that the moai with carved eye sockets were probably allocated to the ahu and ceremonial sites, suggesting that a selective Rapa Nui hierarchy was attributed to the moai design until its demise with the advent of the religion revolving around the tangata manu.;",

As Trajan lay dying, nursed by his wife, Plotina, and closely watched by Prefect Attianus, he could have lawfully adopted Hadrian as heir by means of a simple deathbed wish, expressed before witnesses; but when an adoption document was eventually presented, it was signed not by Trajan but by Plotina, and was dated the day after Trajan's death.;\n1. The Historia Augusta describes Trajan's gift to Hadrian of a diamond ring that Trajan himself had received from Nerva, which \"encouraged [Hadrian's] hopes of succeeding to the throne\".;\n2. An aureus minted early in Hadrian's reign represents the official position; it presents Hadrian as Trajan's \"Caesar\" (Trajan's heir designate).;\n3. During Hadrian's second stint as tribune, the frail and aged reigning emperor Nerva adopted Trajan as his heir; Hadrian was dispatched to give Trajan the news \u2013 or most probably was one of many emissaries charged with this same commission.;\n4.

This battle, which marks the beginning of the Norman Conquest of England, took place approximately 7 miles northwest of Hastings, near the present-day town of Battle, East Sussex, between Caldbec Hill to the north and Telham Hill to the south. It was a decisive victory for the Normans, leading to significant changes in English history and governance. Notably, the battle site, despite the name, is not located in Hastings but nearby, and this pivotal event in history was recorded as \"bellum Haestingas\" or \"Battle of Hastings\" by 1086 in the Domesday Book. Among the English, about 20 individuals including Harold's brothers Gyrth and Leofwine are known to have participated, with a higher mortality presumed among the common soldiers than the recorded noblemen. The Bayeux Tapestry, likely commissioned by Odo of Bayeux soon after the event, serves as a remarkable visual narrative of the lead-up and aftermath of this historic clash."

Just before the anniversary celebrations, artist Paul St George installed the Telectroscope, a video link on the Brooklyn side of the bridge that connected to a matching device on London's Tower Bridge.;\n3.

He was registered as Alexandre C\u00e9sar L\u00e9opold, but baptised as \"Georges\" on 16 March 1840, and was known by this name for the rest of his life.;\n2. In July 1866, Bizet signed another contract with Carvalho, for La jolie fille de Perth, the libretto for which, by Jules-Henri Vernoy de Saint-Georges after Sir Walter Scott, is described by Bizet's biographer Winton Dean as \"the worst Bizet was ever called upon to set\".;\n3. Newman perceives evidence of Bizet's later achievements in many of his earliest works: \"[A]gain and again we light upon some touch or other in them that only a musician with a dramatic root of the matter in him could have achieved.\" Until Carmen, however, Bizet was not essentially an innovator in the musical theatre.;\n4. The prize was awarded jointly to Bizet and Charles Lecocq, a compromise which years later Lecocq criticised on the grounds of the jury's manipulation by Fromental Hal\u00e9vy in favour of Bizet.;\n5. Bizet never published the symphony, which came to light again only in 1933, and was finally performed in 1935.In 1856, Bizet competed for the prestigious Prix de Rome.;\n6. After Bizet's death, many of his manuscripts were lost; works were revised by other hands and published in these unauthorised versions so that it is often difficult to establish what is authentic Bizet.;\n7. From Bizet's unfinished works, Macdonald highlights La coupe du roi de Thul\u00e9 as giving clear signs of the power that would reach a pinnacle in Carmen and suggests that had Clarissa Harlowe and Gris\u00e9lidis been completed, Bizet's legacy would have been \"infinitely richer\".;\n8. Much of Bizet's larger-scale vocal music is lost; the early Te Deum, which survives in full, is rejected by Dean as \"a wretched work [that] merely illustrates Bizet's unfitness to write religious music.;\n9. The musicologist Hugh Macdonald argues that Bizet's best orchestral music is found in the suites that he derived from the 12-movement Jeux d\u2019enfants for piano four-hands (1871) and the musique de sc\u00e8ne for Daudet's play L\u2019Arl\u00e9sienne (1872): Jeux resulted in the Petite suite of 1873, which has five movements (Marche\u2014Berceuse\u2014Impromptu\u2014Duo\u2014Galop), while the musique de sc\u00e8ne resulted in two suites, one from the year of the premiere compiled by Bizet (Pr\u00e9lude\u2014Menuet\u2014Adagietto\u2014Carillon) and the other from 1879 compiled posthumously by Guiraud (Pastorale\u2014Intermezzo\u2014Menuet\u2014Farandole).;\n",

        "rewrite sen": "Grover Cleveland Alexander, known as \"Old Pete\", was an American Major League Baseball pitcher renowned for his significant contributions to the sport. This nickname, \"Old Pete\", originated from \"Alkali Pete\", a moniker given to him during a hunting trip in Texas with Bill Killefer, due to Alexander's dust-covered appearance, which reminded Killefer of characters from early silent western films. The nickname \"Alkali Pete\" evolved into \"Old Pete\" by the late 1920s and had been in public circulation at least since August 10, 1929, as indicated by a newspaper article celebrating Alexander's 373rd game win. This nickname is well-documented in various sources, including his 1940 Playball baseball card and the book \"The World Series and Highlights of Baseball\" by Lamont Buchanan, published in 1951, the year after Alexander's death. Grover Cleveland Alexander's life, marked by his marriage to Amy Marie Arrants, service in World War I, and depiction by Ronald Reagan in the film \"The Winning Team\", makes his story and the nickname \"Old Pete\" an integral part of baseball history."

Clarke's influence extended beyond just introducing Keats to Chapman\u2019s translation; together, they spent a night immersed in the text, with Keats expressing his excitement loudly as passages struck his imagination. Despite the prevailing popularity of the refined translations by John Dryden and Alexander Pope among Keats\u2019s contemporaries, which presented Homer with an urbane finesse, Keats and Clarke shared a preference for the more robust paraphrasing of Chapman. Additionally, Keats's sonnet encapsulates the wonder of discovery, likening his experience to that of astronomers like Herschel, whom Keats would have learned about from Johnny Bonnycastle\u2019s \"An Introduction to Astronomy,\" a book he won while at Enfield Academy. Furthermore, Keats creatively merged elements from William Robertson's \"History of America,\" notably conflating the experiences of Balboa and Cort\u00e9s, demonstrating the poet's inventive engagement with historical and literary texts."

        "rewrite sen": "Wuthering Heights is likely not intended to be interpreted as a mere romantic story. Instead, the passionate, doomed, and death-transcending relationship between Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw Linton that forms the core of the novel, according to narrative analysis, systematically subverts the traditional romantic narrative. Furthermore, the contrast between the stormy, rugged landscape of Wuthering Heights and the cultivated, genteel environment of Thrushcross Grange reflects the novel's exploration of human nature's complexity and the struggle between societal expectations and raw, untamed desire. Emily Bront\u00eb, through her novel, published in 1847, crafts a multifaceted tale that delves deep into the darker aspects of love and human relationships, challenging readers to look beyond a superficial reading of the text as merely a love story."

        "rewrite sen": "Sons and Lovers, a seminal 1913 novel by the English writer D.H. Lawrence, is heralded as one of his most significant works. This semi-autobiographical masterpiece not only probes deep into personal family conflicts, as Lawrence channels his experiences through the characters of William and Paul Morel, but also artfully navigates Paul Morel's complex relationships with his lovers, under the shadow of his devotion to his mother. The work's importance is underlined by its ranking as ninth on the Modern Library's list of the 100 best novels in English of the 20th century in 1999 and its inclusion in The Western Canon by critic Harold Bloom in 1994, as one of the books that have significantly influenced Western culture. Its journey to publication was marked by a critical title change from the initially planned Paul Morel to the more thematic Sons and Lovers, a decision that reinvigorated Lawrence's defense of his novel as a cohesive artistic statement. Adaptations of this novel, including the Academy Award-winning 1960 film, a 1981 BBC TV serial, and a 2003 ITV1 adaptation, attest to its enduring appeal and impact on literature and culture."

Hopes for a new departure were expressed in The Daily Telegraph's review of The Yeomen of the Guard (1888), Sullivan's most serious opera to that point: \"[T]he music follows the book to a higher plane, and we have a genuine English opera, forerunner of many others, let us hope, and possibly significant of an advance towards a national lyric stage.\" Sullivan's only grand opera, Ivanhoe (1891), received generally favourable reviews, although J. A. Fuller Maitland, in The Times, expressed reservations, writing that the opera's \"best portions rise so far above anything else that Sir Arthur Sullivan has given to the world, and have such force and dignity, that it is not difficult to forget the drawbacks which may be found in the want of interest in much of the choral writing, and the brevity of the concerted solo parts.\" Sullivan's 1897 ballet Victoria and Merrie England was one of several late pieces that won praise from most critics: Sir Arthur Sullivan's music is music for the people.;\n2. In 1960 Hughes published the first full-length book about Sullivan's music \"which, while taking note of his weaknesses (which are many) and not hesitating to castigate his lapses from good taste (which were comparatively rare) [attempted] to view them in perspective against the wider background of his sound musicianship.\" The work of the Sir Arthur Sullivan Society, founded in 1977, and books about Sullivan by musicians such as Young (1971) and Jacobs (1986) contributed to the re-evaluation of Sullivan's serious music.;\n3. The Musical Review of that year observed: [S]ome things that Mr. Arthur Sullivan may do, Sir Arthur ought not to do.;\n4. In other words, it will look rather more than odd to see announced in the papers that a new comic opera is in preparation, the book by Mr. W. S. Gilbert and the music by Sir Arthur Sullivan.;\n5. In 1901 Fuller Maitland took issue with the generally laudatory tone of the obituaries: \"Is there anywhere a case quite parallel to that of Sir Arthur Sullivan, who began his career with a work which at once stamped him as a genius, and to the height of which he only rarely attained throughout life?;\n6. Thomas Sullivan was based from 1845 to 1857 at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, where he was the bandmaster and taught music privately to supplement his income.;\n7.

His father was a military bandmaster, clarinettist and music teacher, born in Ireland and raised in Chelsea, London; his mother was English born, of Irish and Italian descent.;\n9. Gilbert adapted the libretto for Sullivan, who, in gratitude, presented his collaborator with an engraved silver cup inscribed \"W.S. Gilbert from his friend Arthur Sullivan.\" Sullivan was not a showy conductor, and some thought him dull and old-fashioned on the podium, but Martyr had an enthusiastic reception and was frequently revived.;\n",

Tommaso Dolabella painted his The Battle of Lepanto in c. 1625\u20131630 on the commission of Stanis\u0142aw Lubomirski, commander of the Polish left wing in the Battle of Khotyn (1621).\n2. The Allegory of the Battle of Lepanto (c. 1572, oil on canvas, 169 x 137 cm, Gallerie dell'Accademia, Venice) is a painting by Paolo Veronese.\n3. Prints of the order of battle appeared in Venice and Rome in 1571, and numerous paintings were commissioned, including one in the Doge's Palace, Venice, by Andrea Vicentino on the walls of the Sala dello Scrutinio, which replaced Tintoretto's Victory of Lepanto, destroyed by fire in 1577.\n4. The battle halted the Ottoman encroachment on Italian territories, but the Holy League did not regain any territories that had been lost to the Ottomans prior to Lepanto.\n5. The Battle of Lepanto was a naval engagement that took place on 7 October 1571 when a fleet of the Holy League, a coalition of Catholic states arranged by Pope Pius V (comprising Spain and its Italian territories, several independent Italian states, and the Sovereign Military Order of Malta), inflicted a major defeat on the fleet of the Ottoman Empire in the Gulf of Patras.\n6. Historian Paul K. Davis writes that More than a military victory, Lepanto was a moral one.\n7. At the start of the 20th century too, Emilio Salgari devoted his historical novel, Il Leone di Damasco (\"The Lion of Damascus\", 1910), to the Battle of Lepanto, which was eventually to be adapted to film by Corrado D'Errico in 1942.In 1942 as well, English author Elizabeth Goudge has a character in her war-time novel, The Castle on the Hill (1942), recall the leading role of John of Austria in the battle and the presence of Cervantes there.\n8. Giovanni Pietro Contarini's History of the Events, which occurred from the Beginning of the War Brought against the Venetians by Selim the Ottoman, to the Day of the Great and Victorious Battle against the Turks was published in 1572, a few months after Lepanto.\n9. An angel descends from heaven bearing a palm branch with a motto for Fernando, who is held up by Philip: \"Majora tibi\" (may you achieve greater deeds; Fernando died as a child, in 1578).",

Many details that would become associated with The Undertaker for the remainder of his career were produced during this rebirth incarnation, such as the addition of sleeve tattoos and Godlike supernatural elements (thunder, lightning and windy weather-like effects used to indicate The Undertaker's presence and wrath).Seeking retribution, The Undertaker revisited his feud with Yokozuna and eventually faced him in a casket rematch at Survivor Series.;\n5. As a result of the interference and repeated ambushes from Mankind on The Undertaker throughout the ensuing weeks, The Undertaker and Mankind competed in their very first on-screen bout at the 1996 King of the Ring, a heated encounter in which The Undertaker presented as uncharacteristically intense.;\n6. After The Undertaker refused and attacked Bearer, Bearer had Mankind set a fireball to the Undertaker's face, leading up to a match at In Your House 14: Revenge of the 'Taker, for which The Undertaker was victorious.;\n7. Histrionic, wailing and ghostly in character, Bearer complemented The Undertaker and was almost always seen bearing an urn which he raised in the air to transmit supernatural healing powers to The Undertaker; this typically resulted in The Undertaker recovering from attacks and counterattacking his adversaries.;\n8. Thus, a severely violent storyline with The Undertaker followed, one revolving around repeated intentional chair shots by Michaels on The Undertaker, Michaels taunting The Undertaker throughout.;\n9. After demanding to know whose side The Undertaker was on and getting the reply, \"Not yours\", Roberts attacked both Bearer and The Undertaker, only for The Undertaker to stand his ground and run Roberts off.;\n",
